        "<p><strong>Generative Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI) represents a cutting-edge domain within machine learning, focused on creating new, synthetic yet realistic data. This includes generating text, images, music, and even biological sequences. At the heart of many generative AI applications are <strong>Large Language Models</strong> (LLMs), which have revolutionized natural language processing and beyond.</p>\n",
        "<p>LLMs are <strong>sophisticated neural networks</strong> trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and interact with human language. Their architecture, often based on <strong>Transformers</strong>, allows them to capture complex patterns and context within data, making them powerful tools for various applications, from chatbots to creative writing and scientific discovery.</p>\n",

        "<p>Transformers are a type of neural network model designed to handle sequential data, such as text, by using self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of input elements relative to each other, enabling the model to understand and generate coherent and contextually relevant outputs.</p>\n",
        "</blockquote>\n",
        "<p>In this tutorial, we will explore the intersection of generative AI and genomics by <strong>pretraining an LLM from scratch on DNA sequences</strong>. This process will equip the model with a foundational understanding of the “grammar” of DNA, enabling it to generate and analyze genetic data with remarkable accuracy.</p>\n",
        "<p><a href=\"https://mistral.ai/\">Mistral AI</a>, French artificial intelligence (AI) startup, recently launched large language models (LLMs) showing performances superior to Llama2. In particular, Mixtral-8x7B implements:</p>\n",
        "<ul>\n",
        "<li><strong>Grouped-Query Attention</strong>: Efficiently computes attention by grouping queries, reducing computational load and memory usage.</li>\n",
        "<li><strong>Sliding-Window Attention</strong>: Focuses on a fixed-size window of tokens, sliding over the sequence to manage long texts efficiently.</li>\n",
        "<li><strong>Byte-fallback BPE Tokenizer</strong>: Tokenizes text into subword units, falling back to byte-level tokenization for unknown words, ensuring robust handling of diverse text inputs.</li>\n",
        "</ul>\n",
        "<p>These techniques collectively enhance the performance and efficiency of large language models, enabling them to process and generate text more effectively.</p>\n",
        "<p>In this tutorial, we will use a simplified Mistral model architecture with fewer layers and hidden units to reduce computational requirements. The model will be trained to predict the next base in the sequence. For instance, for a sequence like <code style=\"color: inherit\">ATTTGTTGGT</code>, the model will be trained to predict the suffix <code style=\"color: inherit\">TTGGT</code> given the prefix <code style=\"color: inherit\">ATTTG</code>. This process is called <strong>causal language modeling</strong>.</p>\n",
        "<p>To pretrain the model, we will use a file containing 100,000 non-overlapping DNA sequences of 200 bases, corresponding to around 1% of the human genome (hg38 assembly). This involves training the model to predict the end of a DNA sequence.</p>\n",
        "<p>By the end of this tutorial, we will obtain a Mistral-DNA model with an internal representation of DNA sequence grammar. This pretrained model can then be used for various applications, such as fine-tuning for classification tasks or predicting mutational effects.</p>\n",

        "<p>When you use a system like ChatGPT, the process involves converting your textual input, or “prompt,” into a numerical vector. This conversion is similar to the process we just did. Here’s how it works:</p>\n",
        "<ul>\n",
        "<li><strong>Input Prompt</strong>: You write a prompt, which is a textual query or statement.</li>\n",
        "<li><strong>Tokenization</strong>: The prompt is tokenized, meaning it is broken down into smaller units, such as words or subwords, using a tokenizer.</li>\n",
        "<li><strong>Vector Representation</strong>: These tokens are then converted into numerical vectors, or embeddings. These vectors capture the semantic meaning and context of the words in the prompt.</li>\n",
        "<li><strong>Model Processing</strong>: The model processes these vectors to generate a response. The embeddings allow the model to understand the context and nuances of your input, enabling it to produce coherent and relevant responses.</li>\n",
        "</ul>\n",
        "<p>This process of converting text into numerical vectors is fundamental to how language models like ChatGPT operate, enabling them to interpret and generate human-like text based on the input they receive.</p>\n",

        "<p>This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to preparing, training, and utilizing a pre-trained language model for DNA sequence analysis. It begins by setting up the necessary resources, including installing dependencies, importing Python libraries, and configuring computational resources. The tutorial then walks through loading and choosing an appropriate model architecture for DNA sequences, followed by setting up a tokenizer to convert DNA sequences into numerical tokens. Data preparation involves loading, tokenizing, splitting, and collating DNA sequences to ensure efficient model training. The training process is detailed with parameter definitions and pretraining steps, culminating in the calculation of DNA sequence embeddings.</p>\n",
        "<p>We can now leverage the pre-trained model in various bioinformatics applications, such as sequence similarity analysis and functional prediction, offering a robust foundation for integrative biological research.</p>\n"
